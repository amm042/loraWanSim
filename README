loraWanSim: lora network simulator

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
loraWanSim splits network simulation into three parts:
 1. Topology generation
 2. Node & gateway transmission schedules
 3. Performance evaluation

The goal of this separation is to simplify the simulator and make various
analyses easier by keeping detailed intermediate files. We focus on LoraWAN
class A devices using acknowledgments as much of the previous work uses
unacknowledged transmissions. Future work will include class B (and C) nodes.

This lora simulator is inspired by LoRaSim by Thiemo Voigt and Martin Bor.

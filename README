loraWanSim: lora network simulator

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
loraWanSim splits network simulation into several parts:
 1. Topology generation (topology.py)
      - Where the nodes are located.
 2. Node configuration (configure.py)
      - The Lora configuration of the nodes.
 3. Application information (application.py)
      - Node application behavior (transmission/retransmission/etc).
 4. Simulation (simulate.py)
      - Takes topology, configuration, and application information to generate
      transmission/reception logs.
 5. Performance evaluation (evaluate.py)
      - Computes and visualizes high-level results of a simulation.

The goal of this separation is to simplify the simulator and make various
analyses easier by keeping detailed intermediate files. We focus on LoraWAN
class A devices using acknowledgments as much of the previous work uses
unacknowledged transmissions. Future work will include class B (and C) nodes.

This lora simulator is inspired by LoRaSim by Thiemo Voigt and Martin Bor.
